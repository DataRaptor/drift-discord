## Overview

This repository contains the code to link Discord accounts to Solana wallet Pubkeys for Drift users.

Click [here](https://client-4fpiw4senq-ue.a.run.app) to view the web app.

Click [here](https://api-4fpiw4senq-ue.a.run.app) to go to the deployed API.

## Services

This repo contains two services, an API and Client.

Documentation for each service can be found in the respective directories. 

## UI

The figma document with my initial designs are in the `docs` directory.

The motive for the design was to provide a clean, delightful and feedback rich experience for our users. For styling I drew inspiration from the Drift homepage.

## Architecture

We follow the standard OAuth procedure with the caveat that we will need to sign and verify signatures from the wallets both on the server. 

The following diagram will explain the control flow.

Particular attention is given to security during interactions between the client and api, namely to verify that the user sending requests are who they say they (via discord access token and Solana wallet signatures). Additionally, we encrypt the discord access tokens via `AES` when the tokens are handed back to the client (although query parameters are secured by SSL, i'd rather not have them in the server logs).

Since we're not doing any complex joins I thought it was sufficient to use a Document store as my DB, I chose mongo. For this usecase, this is fine. We're storing a single model and not doing any complex joins.

## CIDC 

The Client and API are built, tagged and stored in our image registry on push to the `main` branch.

Furthermore, the services will deploy to the links in the `Overview` section.

## Testing

TODO: We have no testing on either service.

## Notes

- The final working and stable prototype after the 8 hours of time allocated can be found on commit hash: `3c7272f`. 

- Subsequent commits are refactors of this code to improve the UI, readability, trigger builds and improve the documentation. 

- If it takes a while initially to load, note that both services are deployed to GCP `cloud-run` which cold starts the containers after some period of inactivity (avoids billing). 

- The frontend code is slightly messy, but with a little more work should start looking nice. Howver, I think the end user who's using it would like it.

- Need to add a final API call to revoke the token.

- Need to store less data. 

- Create a SQL instance and switch to typeorm if time permits.
